Find the Antizin. \n\nWe just weren’t prepared, we… we didn’t know what was in that tunnel. 12 of us set off… only 6 of us are left: Jimmy, Ash, Zach, Andy, Stephen and I made it through that tunnel. Radio’s bust, so there's not really much to do but press forward. I've sent Ash and Zach to the Dam, Andy and Stephen are gonna head down to the coast. Jimmy and I are going to climb that tower… which means we have to go down there, into the forest. We can hear them already… they must’ve fled here for safety after the outbreak… there are so many, and they’re in our way. However, we must go on… we need that Antizin. If you’re reading this… we probably didn’t make it… maybe, maybe you could let Brecken know that we did our best. \n\n - David")
