Anyway, Tom and I ended up kinda stuck, they were blocking our path into the intersection. We climbed up through a ventilation system and ended up in this building. As it turns out, a pretty decent pathway into the Intersection, one not frequented by the Infected - at least not until Tom had anything to say about it. We were on our way back... and we forgot which floor we came in through. Jon took the rest of the group out ahead of us, so Tom - in his infinite wisdom - decided to yell out for Jon to guide us back with sonar or something. Honestly I don't know what goes through that man's head half of the time. Unfortunately, as it turns out, there's a friggen' nest in this building. It was pure luck that we made it back here at all, you know, with having to backtrack in a full sprint and all... but we did do it. Only problem is that it looks like some infected have taken residence on this floor. So I've locked the door for good measure, and I've taken the key with me, find another way if you can... or don't, I'm not your Mom.\n\n- Angela",
