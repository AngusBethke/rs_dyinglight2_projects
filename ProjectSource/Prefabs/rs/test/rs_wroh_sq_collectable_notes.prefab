It wasn't too difficult, the infected inside had pretty much started to rot, and there were no freakish surprises like there were when we fled the Vault. The Villa's still largely intact... which is surprising given a fucking nuke went off in the city. Its position here in the Valley probably allowed the majority of the damage to blow over it. In any case, it's great news. There's also a stockpile of supplies in the basement, it's not a huge amount, but could maybe keep the 200 or so survivors from the Vault going for about 6 months. We could maybe use the time to set up crops and figure out a way to filter the ocean water nearby. \n\nThings are looking bright for the first time in weeks... but Victor looks very troubled. I tried to ask him about it, but he brushed me off... he's busy brooding on the roof right now. That man...",

Anyway, Ahmer refuses to come to a compromise about sharing their crop growing techniques with us, he says he wants to speak with Victor directly and expects a full apology.

Despite this, the knocking was simultaneously exciting and terrifying. It wasn't until Johan (one of Victor's guys) recognised that the knocking was morse code that we decided to do anything about it. Johan translated the message to read \"More alive. Open door.\", and naturally we jumped to it, trying every tool we had available, but to no avail. Johan set to work communicating back... and we got lucky, they knew how to open the door. As it turns out, the control room in our section of the Vault had several commands we had no idea existed – of course it would've helped if we had anyone qualified living in here with us, but such is the nature of Apocalypses I guess. \n\nWhen the door opened, that's when we met them... the locals from Vault 12. It was such a joyous occasion. More people, more faces, more humanity suddenly flooded our lives... I mean, imagine going from believing there are only a few hundred people left in the world to thousands! It was just incredible! The guys from Vault 12 filled us in on the basics. It turns out that most of the quarantined zone is connected by Vaults. The first group to branch out was from Vault 8, heading in both directions they'd managed to open every Vault from 5 to us over the last 12 years. Some Vaults took longer than others, they always started with morse code first for a couple of weeks, and if the door didn't open they transitioned to more drastic methods.
